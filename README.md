### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-----
I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Calgary working on network neuroscience with human brain data. Coming from a physics and theoretical computer science background I love learning about how systems work and how we can improve current infrastructures using data. In my spare time I paint and draw and go out hiking in the mountains.

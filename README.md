### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-----
I'm a network neuroscientist in Emma Towlson's lab at the University of Calgary. My current projects are with human brain network (connectome) data. With a physics and theoretical computer science background I love learning about how systems work and how we can improve current infrastructures using data. In my spare time I paint and draw and go out hiking in the mountains. 

I want to get into AI/ML and NLP so I'm starting to work on mini projects related to the two.
